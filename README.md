Exploratory Data Analysis

This package contains several functions that perform an exploratory data analysis on a given dataset. It provides a numerical and graphical summary of the dataframe and it also offers some customization, as it is possible to remove uninformative columns of the dataframe with a vector and it is also possible to obtain grouped numerical and graphical summaries for any desired variables. The names of the variables and their levels can be transformed to R-Friendly values with Janitor if desired and the results of the graphical summaries can be exported to PDF files.
