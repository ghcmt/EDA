Description: 
    This package contains several functions that perform an exploratory data
    analysis on a given dataset. It provides a numerical and graphical summary
    of the dataframe and it also offers some customization, as it is possible
    to remove uninformative columns of the dataframe with a vector and it is
    also possible to obtain grouped numerical and graphical summaries for any 
    desired variables. The names of the variables and their levels can be
    transformed to R-Friendly values with Janitor if desired and the results
    of the graphical summaries can be exported to PDF files. 
Imports: readxl, kableExtra, ggplot2, ggpubr, dplyr, plyr, pdftools,
        gridExtra, janitor, purrr, tidyverse
